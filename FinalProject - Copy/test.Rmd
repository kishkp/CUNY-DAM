This is a quick test of rCharts in new version of rmarkdown.


```{r results = 'asis', comment = NA}
require(rCharts)
require(knitr)
hair_eye_male <- subset(as.data.frame(HairEyeColor), Sex == "Male")
n1 <- nPlot(Freq ~ Hair, group = "Eye", data = hair_eye_male, 
            type = 'multiBarChart')
n1$show("iframesrc", cdn = TRUE)
```
