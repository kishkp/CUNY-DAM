							IPO NoticesSamvardhana Motherson Finance Ltd (SMFL) IPO Withdrawn 
Samvardhana Motherson Finance Ltd (SMFL) has withdrawn its Rs 1665.00 Crore IPO due to poor response from investor across the board.

SMFL public issue subscribed 0.23 times on its final day of subscription. QIB quota of the IPO subscribed most with bids received for 57% shares. The response in Non Institutional, Retail Individual and Employee Reservation quota was worst in recent years. All of these categories received bids only for 1% of the quota allocated.

As per experts, wrong timing of the IPO and stiff pricing of the shares as two major reasons for the failure of Samvardhana IPO.
