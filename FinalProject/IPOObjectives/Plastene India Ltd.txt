							IPO NoticesPlastene India Limited IPO Withdrawn 
Plastene India Limited has withdrawn its IPO due to poor response from investor.
Plastene India public issue subscribed 0.2900 times on its final day of subscription. NII quota of the IPO subscribed most with bids received for 176% shares. The response in QIB and Retail Individual (RII) was worst. IPO didn't recieve a single bid in QIB quota.

Plastene India stands withdrawn

Dilip Davda (May 15th, 2012)


Plastene India IPO that opened on 09.05.12 and was to close on 15.05.12 got just 29% subscription till 5.00 pm on the last day and thus remained heavily undersubscribed and stood withdrawn. Surprisingly, the subscription pattern has once again raised eyebrows with QIB (0%), HNI (1.76 times) Retail (0.6%) and Employees (0.75%). For this it is said that with some operators having good HNI clients, the issue was subscribed by 1.76 times with under the table deal and for employees portion, company managed to got 75% subscription with loans given to employees, but as far as QIBs concerned, they stayed away from bidding in this offer. We always see that merchant bankers say that they discover the price band from the feedbacks received from this lot for whom the IPO is reserved upto 50% of the total issue, and they only duped them. Against sheer contrast to this, Samvardhana Motherson (SMFL) IPO that got full subscription from Anchor Investors who applied at a lower price band of Rs. 115 failed to garner further response with ultimate subscription of just 38% (including Anchor portion) till the last day and stood withdrawn. Thus Plastene India is the second casualty in just a week's time indicating situation worsening day by day and secondary as well as primary markets are heading for doom.
