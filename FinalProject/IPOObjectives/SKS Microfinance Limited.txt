They are engaged in providing microfinance services to individuals from poor segments of rural India.Company's core business is providing small loans exclusively to poor women predominantly located in rural areas in India. These loans are provided to such members essentially for use in their small businesses or other income generating activities and not for personal consumption. These individuals often have no, or very limited, access to loans from other sources other than private money lenders that they believe typically charge very high rates of interest.SKS uses the group lending model where poor women guarantee each other’s loans.

SKS Microfinance is an effective tool that can help reduce poverty and spread economic opportunity by giving poor people access to financial services, such as credit and insurance. SKS distributes small loans that begin at Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 12,000 (about $44-$260) to poor women so they can start and expand simple businesses and increase their incomes.
