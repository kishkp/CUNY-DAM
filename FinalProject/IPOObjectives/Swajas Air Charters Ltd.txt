Posted on 03 Nov, 2011

As per latest info, Swajas Air has cancelled the issue and inspite of getting 1.72 times subscription, it has opted to refund the application money to all with interest on delayed payment, if any. Thus the issue is not going to be listed. In fact, the company now mulls afresh filing of offer documents and will come at appropriate time with IPO.
